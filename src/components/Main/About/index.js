                        I am a science and math nerd, with an artistic side, and an insatiable thirst for new knowledge and skills. I love taking on new challenges, especially if they require thinking outside the box, and problem solving.

                        I found my love for programming while attempting to expand my artistic skillset into the world of web design. Very early into that journey I found that creating the logic behind a website was just as exciting as designing it, if not more.

                        I believe that programming is a flawless merging of creativity and logic, and luckily for me, those are two of my favorite things!

                        When I am not programming, I am usually spending time with my husband, daughter, and numerous pets, reading, playing games of any sort, drawing, or learning new skills.

                        Other things I enjoy include: music, all animals -including bugs, and conversations about serial killers and true crime.
