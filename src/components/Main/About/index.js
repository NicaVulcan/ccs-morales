                    <h3>Who I Am </h3>
                    <p>
                        While born in Coral Gables, FL, my heart is split down the middle between Nicaragua, where my parents are from, and where I spent most of my childhood, and Charlotte, NC, where I finished growing up, where I found the love of my life, and where I’ve called home for the last 15 years.
                        I am a science and math nerd, with an artistic side, and an insatiable thirst for new knowledge and skills. I love taking on new challenges, especially if they require thinking outside the box, and problem solving.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Why Programming?</h3>
                    <p>
                        I found my love for programming while attempting to expand my artistic skillset into the world of web design. Very early into that journey I found that creating the logic behind a website was just as exciting as designing it, if not more.
                        I believe that programming is the flawless merging of creativity and logic, and luckily for me, those are two of my favorite things!
                    </p>

                    <h3>What I Like</h3>
                    <p>
                        When I am not programming, I am usually spending time with my husband, daughter, and numerous pets, reading, playing games of any kind, drawing, learning new crafts, or roller skating - or attempting to, rather.
                        While not usually the talkative type, you’d have a hard time keeping me quiet if the topic ever turned to biology, zoology, psychology, productivity hacks, and serial killers.
